# BLACKJACK GAME

### INTRO
While the popularity of Blackjack dates from World War I, its roots go back to the 1760s in France, where it is called Vingt-et-Un (French for 21). Today, Blackjack is the one card game that can be found in every gambling casino. The standard 52-card pack is used. 

### OBJECT OF THE GAME
Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

### CARDS VALUE
Face cards are 10, the ace is worth 11 and any other card is its pip value. Two cards are given to both player and dealer. The dealer only shows one of his cards, in order to give some sort of information to the player regarding standing or trying to get a better play by hitting. 

### PLAYER´S PLAY
After the cards are dealt to dealer and player, the player  goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt to them, or they may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until deciding to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). In the latter case, the player loses. 

### DEALER´S PLAY
When the dealer has served the player, the dealers face-down card is turned up. If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, they must take a card. The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand. The dealer's decisions, then, are automatic on all plays, whereas the player always has the option of taking one or more cards.
